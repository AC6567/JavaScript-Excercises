#JavaScript Exercises

This repo will contain JavaScript problems and solutions that can be used to practice your knowledge of basic, intermediate and advanced JavaScript. I created this repo because I could not find a lot of examples that I could use to quickly practice without navigating through a website or challenge (i.e. HackerRank, CoderByte).

This repo will be used to hold problems from various sources and then converted into a number of mediums for practice including a Node.js workshop so you can do these challenges interactively in your terminal (that way, you will be learning JavaScript while becoming a ninja at shell commands) and a web & mobile app using Meteorjs.
